# Expansion tests

Run the test cases in this package to generate expanded code.

Cargo expand must be installed. You can install it via cargo:

```shell
cargo install cargo-expand
```

Install `rustfmt` as well to ensure formatted expanded output.

```shell
rustup component add rustfmt --toolchain nightly
```
